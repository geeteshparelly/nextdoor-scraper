# Outreach Playbook

## Philosophy

Your outreach should feel like a helpful neighbor, not a pushy salesman.

**The goal:** Start a conversation, not close a deal in one message.

## Outreach Principles

1. **Personalize** — Reference how you found them, something specific about their business
2. **Lead with value** — What's in it for them? Not what you're selling
3. **Be brief** — Under 100 words for initial contact
4. **Clear CTA** — One specific next step
5. **No pressure** — They can say no, that's fine
6. **Follow up** — Most deals happen on follow-up 2-4

## Message Structure

### Initial Outreach (Day 0)

```
[Personalized hook — how you found them / why them]

[Value proposition — what's in it for them]

[Credibility — brief proof you're legit]

[CTA — one clear ask]

[Sign-off]
```

**Example:**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw your business recommended on Nextdoor by three different 
people in Oak Hill — that kind of word-of-mouth is gold.

Noticed you don't have a website yet. I build simple sites for 
local businesses like yours — $100 flat, done in a week. Helps 
people find you on Google instead of just word-of-mouth.

Interested in seeing some examples?

- [Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up #1 (Day 3)

```
[Brief reference to first message]

[Add value — new angle or additional info]

[Softer CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
Hey [Name], following up on my message from a few days ago.

Quick thought — even a simple one-page site can help people 
find your number on Google instead of calling your competitors.

Happy to show you what it'd look like. No pressure either way.

- [Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)

```
[Acknowledge they're busy]

[Different angle or new value]

[Easy out + CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
[Name] — I know you're busy running a business.

Last thing I'll say: I saw you have 4.8 stars on Google with 
50+ reviews. A website would let you show those off and get 
even more customers finding you.

If now's not the right time, no worries. But if you want to 
chat, just reply "interested" and I'll send over some examples.

- [Your Name]
```

### Final Attempt (Day 14)

```
[Acknowledge this is last reach-out]

[Summarize value]

[Clear close or move on]
```

**Example:**
```
[Name] — Last note from me.

Simple offer: $100 website, done in a week, helps people find 
you on Google. If that's not interesting, I totally get it.

If you ever want to chat, my info's below. Good luck with the 
business either way — sounds like you're doing great work.

- [Your Name]
[Phone]
```

## Channel-Specific Tips

### Phone/Text
- Best for urgent/high-value leads
- Call during business hours
- If voicemail: leave brief message + follow up via text
- Text template: Keep under 160 characters

### Email
- Include subject line that gets opened
- Good subjects: "[Their Business] + website idea" or "Quick question about [Business]"
- Don't use spammy words (FREE, ACT NOW, etc.)

### Facebook/Instagram DM
- Keep very short (2-3 sentences)
- Expect lower response rate
- Better for younger business owners

### In-Person (if applicable)
- Best conversion rate
- Bring a visual (phone with portfolio)
- Don't be pushy — leave a card

## Subject Lines That Work

For email:
- "Quick question about [Business Name]"
- "[Business Name] — saw the great reviews"
- "Website idea for [Business Name]"
- "Helping [City] [industry] get found online"

## What NOT to Do

❌ Long, rambling messages
❌ Talking about yourself too much
❌ Generic templates with no personalization
❌ Pushy or desperate tone
❌ Following up more than 4 times
❌ Lying or exaggerating
❌ Insulting their current situation
❌ CC'ing multiple people
❌ Attaching files in first message
