## Follow-Up #1 (Day 3)

### Email/Text Version

```
Hey [Name], following up on my message about a website for [Business Name].

I know you're busy — just wanted to make sure it didn't get buried.

Quick offer: $[Price] for a simple site that helps people find you on 
Google. Takes about a week.

Worth a quick look at some examples?

- [Your Name]
```

### Shorter Text Version

```
Hi [Name], following up from a few days ago. Still happy to show you 
what a simple website for [Business Name] could look like. Let me know!
```

## Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)

### Email/Text Version

```
[Name] — one more thought on the website idea.

Right now, when someone searches "[industry] [city]", your competitors 
with websites show up first. You've got the reviews to compete, just 
need to be visible.

$[Price], done in a week. I can send examples if you're curious.

Either way, no pressure — just wanted to make sure you had the option.

- [Your Name]
```

### Add-Value Version

```
Hey [Name], me again.

Quick tip even if you're not interested in my help: Make sure your 
Google Business profile is claimed and updated. It's free and helps 
you show up in local searches.

If you ever want a full website to go with it, I'm around. $[Price].

- [Your Name]
```

## Final Attempt (Day 14)

### Email/Text Version

```
[Name] — last note from me on this.

If a website for [Business Name] isn't a priority right now, I totally 
get it. Running a business is a lot.

If you ever want to revisit, my offer stands: $[Price] for a simple, 
professional site. Happy to help whenever.

Good luck with everything — sounds like you're doing great work.

- [Your Name]
```

### Very Short Version

```
[Name] — last follow-up from me. If a website isn't right for now, no 
worries. Offer's always open if things change. Good luck! - [Your Name]

## Response Templates

### If They Show Interest

```
Great! Here are a few examples of sites I've done for [industry]:

[Link 1]
[Link 2]

For [Business Name], I'm thinking something similar — clean, mobile-
friendly, shows your [services/work/menu] and makes it easy to contact you.

Want to hop on a quick call to talk details? Or I can put together a 
mockup if you send me some info about your business.
```

### If They Say "Not Right Now"

```
Totally understand — timing is everything.

Would it be okay if I checked back in a couple months? No pressure, 
just want to help when the time is right.

Either way, good luck with the business!
```

### If They Say "How Much Again?"

```
$[Price] flat. That includes:
- Design and build
- Mobile-friendly (looks good on phones)
- Your services/menu/portfolio
- Contact form or click-to-call
- Basic SEO so you show up on Google
- Done in about a week

No monthly fees, no hidden costs. You own it.

Sound good?
```

### If They Ask for References

```
Absolutely! Here are a few recent clients:

[Business 1] - [Location] - [Link or "happy to connect you"]
[Business 2] - [Location] - [Link or "happy to connect you"]

I can also send screenshots of reviews if that helps.
