# Voicemail & Call Scripts

## Cold Call Script

### Opening (if they answer)

```
Hi, is this [Name]? 

Hey [Name], this is [Your Name]. I'll be super quick — I saw [Business 
Name] recommended on [Nextdoor/had great reviews on Google] and noticed 
you don't have a website.

I help local businesses like yours get found online. Simple one-page 
site, $[Price], done in a week.

Is that something you'd be interested in, or should I let you go?
```

### If They Say "Tell Me More"

```
Sure! Basically, when people search "[industry] [city]" on Google, 
businesses with websites show up first. Without one, you're invisible 
to those searchers.

I build simple sites that show what you do, your contact info, and 
maybe some reviews or photos. Nothing fancy, just professional and 
effective.

$[Price] flat, takes about a week. I can send you some examples if 
you want to see what yours could look like.

Want me to text those over?
```

### If They're Busy

```
No problem at all — I know you're working. 

Can I send you a quick text with my info and some examples? You can 
check it out when you have a minute.

[Get permission, send text follow-up]

Let me know if you're interested!

## Objection Handling

### "I don't need a website"

```
Totally fair — a lot of businesses do great with word-of-mouth alone.

Just something to think about: when people search "[your service] near 
me", businesses with websites show up first. It's basically free 
advertising 24/7.

But if now's not the right time, I get it. Mind if I check back in a 
few months?
```

### "I can't afford it right now"

```
I hear you — running a business is expensive.

Here's how I think about it: if the site brings you even one extra job, 
it probably pays for itself. And there's no monthly fees after the 
initial cost.

If budget is tight now, I'm happy to check back in a month or two. 
Would that work?
```

### "I'll think about it"

```
No rush at all. 

Want me to send you some examples to look at? Sometimes seeing what 
it could look like makes the decision easier.

I'll follow up in a few days if I don't hear from you — no pressure.
```

### "I have a nephew/friend who does websites"

```
Nice! Family/friends helping out is great.

If that falls through or you want a second option, my offer's always 
open. $[Price], professional result, done in a week.

Good luck with everything!
```

### "Send me information"

```
Absolutely! What's the best way to reach you — email or text?

[Get contact]

Perfect, I'll send over some examples and pricing today. Talk soon!
