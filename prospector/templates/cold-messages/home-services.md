## Template 1: Nextdoor Recommendation

```
Hey [Name/Business],

Saw [Business Name] recommended on Nextdoor by neighbors in [Neighborhood]. 
Three different people said you do great work — that's not easy to earn.

Quick idea: a simple website could help more people find you when they 
search "[service] near me" on Google. Right now, they might be calling 
your competitors instead.

I build one-page sites for local pros like you. $[Price], done in a week.

Want to see an example?

## Template 2: No Website Spotted

```
Hi [Name],

Found [Business Name] on [Yelp/Google] — [X] stars with [Y] reviews is 
impressive. Your customers clearly trust you.

One thing I noticed: you don't have a website listed. That means when 
someone Googles "[service] [city]", they might not find you.

I help local contractors fix that. Simple site, shows your work, makes 
your phone ring. $[Price] flat.

Interested in a quick look at what yours could look like?

- [Your Name]
```

## Template 3: Direct Value

```
[Name] — quick question.

How are most of your customers finding you right now? Word of mouth?

A lot of [industry] pros I work with say the same thing. The problem is 
you're leaving money on the table from people who search online first.

I build simple websites that help local businesses show up on Google. 
Not fancy, just effective. $[Price].

Worth a 5-minute chat?

- [Your Name]
[Phone]

## Template 4: Compliment + Offer

```
Hey [Name],

Just saw your work on [Yelp/Nextdoor/Google] — [specific compliment: 
"the kitchen remodel photos look amazing" / "those reviews are glowing"].

Do you have a website where people can see more of your work? I couldn't 
find one when I searched.

If not, I can help. I make simple sites for contractors that showcase 
your projects and make it easy for customers to call. $[Price], done fast.

Let me know if you'd like to see examples.

- [Your Name]

## Template 5: Short & Direct (Text Message)

Do you have a website? I build simple sites for local contractors - 
helps you show up when people search. $[Price] flat.

Interested? - [Your Name]
