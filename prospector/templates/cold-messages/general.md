## Template 1: Universal Nextdoor Find

```
Hey [Name],

Saw [Business Name] recommended on Nextdoor — [X] people saying good 
things about your work. That kind of word-of-mouth is hard to earn.

I noticed you don't have a website. That means when someone Googles 
"[what they do] [city]", they might miss you.

I build simple one-page websites for local businesses. Shows what you 
do, makes it easy to contact you, helps you show up on Google. $[Price].

Want to see an example?

- [Your Name]

## Template 2: Universal No-Website

```
Hi [Name],

Found [Business Name] on [Google/Yelp] — [X] stars with [Y] reviews 
shows you're doing great work.

One thing I noticed: no website. That means potential customers 
searching online might not find you.

I build simple sites for local businesses like yours. Nothing fancy — 
just clean, professional, and shows up on Google. $[Price] flat.

Interested in seeing what yours could look like?

- [Your Name]
```

## Template 3: Universal Review-Based

```
[Name] — your reviews on [Google/Yelp] are solid.

"[Quote a short great review]"

That kind of feedback should be on a website where everyone can see 
it — not just people who dig through Yelp.

I build simple sites for local businesses that put your best reviews 
front and center. $[Price], done in a week.

Worth a quick look?

- [Your Name]
```

## Template 4: Universal Competitor Angle

```
Hey [Name],

When I searched for [industry] in [City], I found a few businesses 
with websites. Couldn't find one for [Business Name] though.

You've got the reviews to compete ([X] stars), but without a site, 
you're less visible than competitors who have one.

I help local businesses fix that. Simple website, shows up on Google, 
$[Price]. Takes about a week.

Interested?

- [Your Name]
```

## Template 5: Universal Text Message

```
Hi! Is this [Business Name]? Great reviews on Google.

Do you have a website? I build simple sites for local businesses - 
helps you show up when people search. $[Price] flat.

Interested? - [Your Name]
```

## Template 6: Universal Value Prop

```
[Name] — quick thought for [Business Name].

Most people search online before hiring someone. If you don't have a 
website, you're invisible to them.

I build simple websites for local businesses. One page, looks 
professional, shows up on Google. $[Price] and done in a week.

Even a basic site beats no site.
