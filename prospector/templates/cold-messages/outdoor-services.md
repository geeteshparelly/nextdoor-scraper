## Template 1: Seasonal Angle

```
Hey [Name],

[Spring/Summer] is coming and I know that's busy season for lawn care. 
Saw [Business Name] recommended by neighbors in [Area] — sounds like 
you're the go-to.

Quick thought: a simple website could help new customers find you when 
they Google "lawn care [city]" instead of hoping for a Nextdoor recommendation.

I build one-page sites for local pros. $[Price], done in a week, helps 
your phone ring more.

Want to see what yours could look like?

## Template 2: Before/After Focus

```
Hi [Name],

Landscaping is visual — people want to see what you can do before they hire.

I noticed [Business Name] doesn't have a website to show off your work. 
That means potential customers can't see those before/after transformations 
that would sell them immediately.

I build simple sites for landscapers with photo galleries, service lists, 
and easy contact. $[Price] flat.

Got a few project photos? I could mock up what your site would look like.

- [Your Name]

## Template 3: Review Highlight

```
[Name] — saw [Business Name] has [X] stars on [Yelp/Google].

"[Quote a short, great review]"

That kind of feedback sells better than any ad. But right now, only 
people who search Yelp see it.

A website puts those reviews front and center for everyone who Googles 
"[service] [city]." Plus you'd show up in more searches.

$[Price] for a clean, simple site. Interested?

## Template 4: Competitor Awareness

```
Hey [Name],

I was searching for lawn care in [City] and noticed a few of your 
competitors have websites — but I couldn't find one for [Business Name].

You've got the reviews to compete ([X] stars), but without a site, 
you're invisible to anyone who searches online first.

I fix that. Simple website, shows up on Google, $[Price]. Done in a week.

Want to see examples?

- [Your Name]

## Template 5: Text Message Version

```
Hi! Is this [Business Name]? Found you on Nextdoor - great reviews.

Do you have a website? I help lawn care pros get found on Google with 
simple sites. $[Price] flat.

Interested? - [Your Name]
```
