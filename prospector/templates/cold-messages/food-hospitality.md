## Template 1: Menu Online

```
Hey [Name],

Tried to look up [Business Name]'s menu online but couldn't find a 
website — just Yelp reviews (which are great, by the way: [X] stars!).

Most people check the menu before they visit. A simple site with your 
menu, hours, and location could bring in more customers who are searching 
"[cuisine] near me."

I build clean, mobile-friendly sites for local restaurants. $[Price], 
done in a week.

Want to see an example?

## Template 2: Food Truck / Mobile Business

```
Hi [Name],

Running a food truck means you're always on the move — but your customers 
need to know where to find you.

A simple website with your schedule, menu, and a way to book catering 
could help people track you down (and hire you for events).

I build sites for mobile food businesses. One page, works great on phones, 
$[Price].

Interested in seeing what it'd look like?

- [Your Name]
```

## Template 3: Catering Focus

```
[Name] — quick question.

When someone wants to book [Business Name] for catering, how do they 
learn about your packages and pricing?

Right now I don't see a website where they could browse options. That 
might mean you're losing catering leads to competitors who have one.

I build simple sites that showcase your catering menu, packages, and 
make it easy to request a quote. $[Price].

Worth a look?

- [Your Name]
```

## Template 4: Social Proof Angle

```
Hey [Name],

Just saw someone post about [Business Name] on [Nextdoor/Instagram] — 
the [dish name] looked incredible.

You're clearly doing something right. But when I tried to Google you, 
I couldn't find a website.

A simple site with your menu, photos of your food, and those great 
reviews could turn "saw it on social media" into "let's go there tonight."

$[Price] for a clean site that makes you look as good as your food tastes.

- [Your Name]
```

## Template 5: Text Message Version

```
Hi! Is this [Business Name]? Saw the great reviews on Google.

Do you have a website with your menu? I build simple sites for 
restaurants - helps people find you when they search. $[Price] flat.

Interested? - [Your Name]
```
