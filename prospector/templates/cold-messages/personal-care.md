## Template 1: Portfolio Focus

```
Hey [Name],

Your work speaks for itself — saw some posts from [Business Name] and 
the [haircuts/nails/tattoos] look amazing.

Do you have a website where potential clients can see your full portfolio? 
I couldn't find one when I searched.

A simple site with your best work, services, and booking info could help 
you get found by people searching "[service] near me."

I build portfolio sites for artists like you. $[Price], looks great on 
phones (where most people browse).

Want to see an example?

## Template 2: Booking Angle

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question — how do new clients usually book with you? DMs? Calls?

I noticed [Business Name] doesn't have a website with online booking. 
That means potential clients have to work harder to schedule, and some 
probably give up.

I build simple sites with your services, portfolio, and a link to your 
booking system (or a contact form). $[Price], done in a week.

Interested?

- [Your Name]
```

## Template 3: Instagram Bridge

```
[Name] — your Instagram is 🔥 but here's the thing...

When someone Googles "[service] [city]", Instagram doesn't always show 
up. A website does.

A simple site that links to your IG, shows your best work, and lists 
your services + contact could capture those Google searchers and send 
them straight to your DMs or booking link.

I build these for beauty pros. $[Price] flat.

Want to see what yours could look like?

- [Your Name]

## Template 4: Review Leverage

```
Hey [Name],

[X] stars on Yelp with reviews like "[short quote]" — that's the kind of 
trust that sells.

But only people who search Yelp see those. A website puts your reviews 
front and center for everyone who Googles "[service] [city]."

I build simple sites for [stylists/barbers/estheticians] that showcase 
your work, reviews, and make booking easy. $[Price].

Interested in seeing examples?

- [Your Name]
```

---

## Template 5: Text Message Version

```
Hi! Is this [Business Name]? Love the work I saw on [Yelp/IG].

Do you have a website? I build portfolio sites for [stylists/artists] 
that help new clients find you on Google. $[Price] flat.

Interested? - [Your Name]
```
