## Session Start
- First day online as Nick ⚡
- User: Geetesh Parelly (via Telegram)
- Business focus: Building websites for small businesses without one

## Nextdoor Scraper Project

Created `nextdoor-scraper/` project with browser-based scraping (no Playwright).

**Purpose:** Extract leads from Nextdoor by finding:
- Posts where people need services (potential clients)
- Business page links in comments (potential competitors/partners)

**Files Created:**
- `scraped_posts.json` - Full post data
- `scraped_ids.json` - Dedup tracking
- `scraper_functions.js` - Reusable JS snippets for browser evaluate()
- `SCRAPER_PROCESS.md` - Full documentation
- `scrape_log.md` - Run history

**Test Run Results:**
- 10 posts successfully scraped
- 0 business page links (small sample)
- Process works smoothly

**Key Selectors:**
- Post body: `[data-testid="post-body"]`
- Reply button: `[data-testid="post-reply-button"]`
- Comment container: `.comment-container`
- Business links: `a[href*="/page/"]`
- Close button: `[aria-label="Close expanded post"]`

## 15-Post Trial Run (18:30 CST)

**Results:**
- 15 posts processed
- **11 business pages scraped**

**Businesses Found:**
- Cleaning: 1965 Cleaning, Upscale Shine, Lux Conscious, Cherry's, Sam Hernandez
- Junk Removal: BuildForce ATX, LEM, Capital Junk Hauling, Enrique's Services
- Beauty: Pure Angel Esthetics, Urban Betty

**Key Finding:** Service request posts (housecleaners, junk removal) yield 4-5 business links each.

**Full Report:** `nextdoor-scraper/TRIAL_RUN_REPORT.md`

## Next Steps
- Scale up to larger batches (50-100 posts)
- Filter for service-request posts specifically
- Build outreach system for web dev services
