## Web Design Skill Installed
- **Location:** `skills/web-design/SKILL.md`
- **Purpose:** Mandatory rulebook for all website builds
- **Key rules:**
  - NEVER use Inter/Roboto/Arial as primary fonts
  - NEVER use purple gradients on white (AI slop tell)
  - ALWAYS pair distinctive heading + body fonts
  - ALWAYS include: page load stagger, scroll reveals, hover states, 1 "wow moment"
  - Use at least 3 advanced animation patterns per project
  - Break the standard hero → 3-cards → CTA → footer pattern
  - No lorem ipsum — write real copy
  - Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
  - Ask max 2-3 questions, then BUILD
- **Font pairings to rotate:** DM Serif Display/DM Sans, Playfair Display/Source Sans Pro, Bebas Neue/Source Sans Pro, Cormorant Garamond/Proza Libre, etc.
- **Anti-patterns:** centered generic hero, three identical cards, same padding everywhere, no animations
