## Beast World School Landing Page

### Project Status
- **Location:** `beast-world-school/index.html`
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/geeteshparelly/Beast-World-School
- **Live:** https://geeteshparelly.github.io/Beast-World-School/

### Current Work: Tunnel/Selection Section Rewrite
Rewriting the 5-gate tunnel animation because all gates were stacking/visible simultaneously.

**New Architecture:**
- CSS: All `.gate` elements start `opacity: 0`, only `#gate-header` starts visible
- IDs: `#gate-header` (intro text), `#gate1`-`#gate4` (numbered gates)
- Single GSAP timeline with `end: '+=500vh'`, `scrub: 1`
- One element visible at a time with scale/fade transitions
- Gate 1 needs counter animation (0 → 100,000)
- Gate 4 ("40") stays visible at end (no fade out)

**Timeline Positions:**
- Header fades out: 0.15-0.20
- Gate 1 appears: 0.20, fades: 0.35-0.40
- Gate 2 appears: 0.40, fades: 0.55-0.60
- Gate 3 appears: 0.60, fades: 0.75-0.80
- Gate 4 appears: 0.80, stays visible

**Progress:**
- [x] Updated CSS with new selectors
- [ ] Update HTML structure
- [ ] Create GSAP timeline
- [ ] Add counter animation

### Design Constraints (from earlier)
- Dark mode = default (no class), light mode = `.light-mode` class
- Light mode exact hex: #ffffff, #f7f7f7, #f0f0f0 (NOT warm/cream)
- No `scroll-behavior: smooth` (conflicts with GSAP)
- Mobile breakpoint 768px - no ScrollTrigger pins on mobile
- Tunnel uses `scale()` transforms (not translateZ)

### Section Details
- Journey map: z-index 1, 400vh
- Gauntlet tunnel: z-index 2, 500vh (overlays map)
- Card timing synced with airplane: Africa 0.20, India 0.50, Amazon 0.80
