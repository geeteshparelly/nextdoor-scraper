## Nextdoor Scraper Project

### File Structure Update
- Created `scraped_list/` folder for individual run JSONs
- Naming format: `[posts] - [businesses] businesses - [mm-dd-yyyy].json`
- Master list stays in `businesses.json` (cumulative, for dedup)
- Last run: `15 - 22 businesses - 02-06-2026.json` found 22 new businesses

### Current Business Count
- **27 total businesses** in master list as of 02/06
- Lots of landscaping, handyman, and construction services in Austin area

### Scraping Process (Final Version)
1. Click `[data-testid="post-reply-button"]`
2. Wait 2.5s for comments to load
3. Regex search HTML for `/page/` links
4. Filter out already-logged + excluded pages
5. Add new to JSON file
6. Escape, repeat

### Excluded Pages
- `/page/mysa` (news)
- `/page/kvue` (news)
- `/page/conversation-starter` (system)
