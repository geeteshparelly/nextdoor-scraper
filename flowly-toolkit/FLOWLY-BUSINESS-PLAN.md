## 📝 Sales Script Additions

**When they ask about selling online:**
> "Absolutely! Our Commerce plan includes a full shopping cart. Customers can browse your products, add to cart, and pay with credit card. You get an email for each order with their shipping address. Stripe handles the payment — they take about 3%, you keep the rest. You just pack and ship!"

**When they hesitate on price:**
> "I totally get it. Here's the thing — this isn't a monthly subscription like Wix or Squarespace where you pay forever. This is one time, you own it, and it's professionally built. Most agencies charge $2,000+ for what I'm doing at $250."

**When they want to think about it:**
> "No pressure at all! Here's my card. I actually already made a demo site for businesses like yours — want me to text you the link so you can see what it would look like?"

*This plan is a living document. Update as we learn what works.*

**Nick's confidence level: 95%** — I can deliver everything in Starter, Pro, and Commerce tiers TODAY. Premium tier is also doable with slightly more time. Let's get this money. 🚀
