## 🏠 BIG EVENT: AUSTIN HOME & GARDEN SHOW

**Dates:** February 27 - March 1, 2026 (Fri-Sun)
**Location:** Palmer Events Center, 900 Barton Springs Rd
**Admission:** Check website for tickets

### Why This is GOLD
- Hundreds of **contractors** in one building
- Roofing, landscaping, HVAC, pool builders, painters, remodelers
- These businesses NEED websites but often just have phone numbers
- 3 full days to work the booths

### Target Industries

- Landscaping companies  
- Pool builders
- Painters
- Flooring companies
- HVAC contractors
- Kitchen/bath remodelers
- Window/door installers
- Fence companies
- Garage door companies
- Solar installers

### Strategy
1. Walk every aisle first to scout
2. Look at booth signage for website URLs
3. Pull up any URL on your phone - if it's bad, that's your pitch
4. Target booths with just phone numbers (no website)
5. Use Roast2Site to demo live analysis
