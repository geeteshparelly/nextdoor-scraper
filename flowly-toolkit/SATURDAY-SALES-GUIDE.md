# 🔥 Geetesh's Saturday Sales Guide

## Your Pitch Script

### The Opening (Keep it natural)
Walk up to their booth, look at their stuff genuinely, then:

> "Hey! I love your [specific product]. Do you have a website?"

**If they say NO:**

> "Really? I'm Geetesh — I'm 16, and I build websites for small businesses. I've been learning web design to help pay for college.
>
> Can I show you some websites I've already made for other local businesses? It'll take 30 seconds."

*Pull out phone, show them the QR code doc or open a demo site*

> "I can build you something like this for just $100. And honestly, if you're not sure, I could even do the first one free — I just want real feedback from business owners like you."

**If they say YES (they have a website):**

> "Oh nice! Can I see it?"

*Look at it genuinely, then:*

> "That's cool! If you ever want to upgrade it or know someone who needs a website, I'd love to help. Here's my card/number."

### Handling Objections

**"I don't need a website"**
> "I get it — a lot of business comes from word-of-mouth. But when someone hears about you and Googles your name, what do they find? A simple website means they see YOU, not your competitors."

**"I don't have time for that"**
> "Totally understand. That's the best part — I do all the work. I just need your name, phone number, and a few photos. Takes you 5 minutes, and I handle everything else."

**"I can't afford it right now"**
> "No pressure at all. Here's the thing — I'm trying to build my portfolio, so I'm flexible. What if I built it for free and you just give me a testimonial if you like it?"

**"Let me think about it"**
> "Absolutely! Can I get your number so I can send you a link to some examples? No pressure — just so you have it when you're ready."
