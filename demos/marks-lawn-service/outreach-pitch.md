## Cold Call Script

**Opening:**
> "Hi, is this Mark? My name is Geetesh. I saw you're helping a lot of folks on Nextdoor with lawn care — you've got great reviews in the East Austin area."

**The Hook:**
> "I noticed you don't have a website yet, and I think you're leaving money on the table. When people search 'lawn care Austin' on Google, they can't find you — but they can find your competitors."

**The Offer:**
> "I build simple, professional websites for local service businesses like yours. One page, mobile-friendly, shows up on Google. I can have yours done in 48 hours for just $100."

**Handle Objections:**

*"I get all my work from Nextdoor"*
> "That's great — Nextdoor is awesome for word of mouth. But a website lets you show up when strangers search Google. Plus you can put the link in your Nextdoor bio and look more professional than guys who don't have one."

*"I don't need a website"*
> "I hear you. But think about this: when someone recommends you, the first thing people do is Google your name. Right now, nothing comes up. A website makes you look legit and closes that gap."

*"That's too expensive"*
> "$100 is less than one lawn job. And it works for you 24/7, even when you're busy mowing. It pays for itself with one new customer."

**Close:**
> "Want me to send you a mockup? No commitment — if you don't like it, no charge. What's the best email to send it to?"
