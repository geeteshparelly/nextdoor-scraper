|------|-------------|-----------|
| Elegant | Playfair Display, Cormorant | Lora, Crimson Text |
| Modern | Outfit, Space Grotesk | DM Sans, Work Sans |
| Bold | Bebas Neue, Oswald, Anton | Source Sans 3, Rubik |

### Colors
- Industry-specific palettes (see industry-directions.md)

### Taglines

### Headers
- Business name as logo (styled text OK)

## The Smell Test

Before delivering a site, ask:

1. **Does this look like 10,000 other AI sites?**
   - If yes, redesign with industry-specific direction

2. **Would this business owner be proud to show this?**
   - If generic, add personality

3. **Can I tell the industry in 2 seconds?**
   - Lawn = green/earthy, Cleaning = teal/fresh, etc.

4. **Does the copy sound human?**
   - Read it out loud. Does it sound like marketing BS?

5. **Are there any purple gradients?**
   - Remove them immediately

## Quick Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Looks too "AI" | Change fonts to industry-specific |
| Generic colors | Apply industry palette |
| Boring layout | Try split hero or asymmetric design |
| Stock tagline | Write something specific to this business |
| No personality | Add owner name, years in business, local details |
| Flat design | Add shadows, hover effects, depth |

## Examples: Good vs Bad

### Bad (AI Slop)
```
Font: Inter
Color: #6366f1 purple gradient
Tagline: "Your Home, Our Passion"
Hero: Generic stock photo
```

### Good (Real Business Feel)
```
Font: Oswald (lawn care = bold, outdoorsy)
Color: #2d6a4f forest green
Tagline: "Keeping Austin Lawns Green Since 2018"
Hero: Real lawn mowing action shot from Unsplash
```

## The Golden Rule

> **If you can swap the business name and it still works for any industry, it's too generic.**

A lawn care site should not work for a salon.
A plumbing site should not work for a bakery.
Every industry has a different FEEL.
