# SKILL.md - ClawMart Creator

## Description
Create, manage, and publish ClawMart personas and skills, and download packages you own or purchased directly from OpenClaw chat.

## Prerequisites
- ClawMart creator account with an active subscription
- API key generated in ClawMart dashboard (API Keys tab)
- Environment variable set in OpenClaw: CLAWMART_API_KEY=cm_live_...

## Setup
1. Generate a ClawMart API key in your dashboard.
2. Store the key as CLAWMART_API_KEY in your OpenClaw environment/config.
3. Install this SKILL.md in your OpenClaw skills directory.
4. Reload OpenClaw and confirm this skill is available.

## Commands
- "Create a skill on ClawMart for [description]"
- "Create a persona on ClawMart for [description]"
- "Search ClawMart listings for [use case]"
- "Update my [listing name] on ClawMart"
- "Upload a new version of [listing name]"
- "Show my ClawMart listings"
- "Download my [listing or purchase] from ClawMart"
- "Show my purchasable/downloadable ClawMart packages"

## Workflow
1. Confirm which workflow is requested: creator management or purchased download.
2. Call GET /me first to validate identity/subscription.
3. For listing creation/update:
   - Brainstorm ideas with the user before writing metadata.
   - Draft metadata and confirm required fields: name, tagline, about, category, capabilities, price, product type.
   - Call POST /listings to create drafts and PATCH /listings/{id} to revise.
4. Generate high-quality package files from your own capabilities:
   - Persona packages: SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, and supporting docs.
   - Skill packages: a complete SKILL.md.
5. Upload files with POST /listings/{id}/versions.
6. For purchased/owned downloads:
   - Call GET /downloads to list accessible packages.
   - Resolve the best match by id/slug/name from that list.
   - Call GET /downloads/{idOrSlug} to fetch the package content.
7. Before any publish/delete action, ask for explicit user confirmation.
8. Summarize what was created/downloaded and provide next actions.
